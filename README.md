## Why this Project
Building a layout and populating its fields from data received as JSON is a common task for Android Developers. Although JSON parsing is usually done using libraries, writing the JSON parsing for this project will help you to better understand how it is processed.

## What I Learned

* How to submit projects for review.
* Practice JSON parsing to a model object.
* Design an activity layout.
* Populate all fields in the layout accordingly.
